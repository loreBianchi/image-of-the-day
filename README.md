# Image Of The Day

This project is a lightweight FastAPI application that generates artistic images from news headlines and displays them in a simple web gallery.
The system reads RSS feeds, builds a creative prompt, generates an image using an AI model, and stores both the prompt and the generated image.
FastAPI is currently used only to serve the gallery UI and static images
